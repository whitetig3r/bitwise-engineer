This is the repository that contains the source for my blog. It uses the starter at [lewislbr/lewis-gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/lewislbr/lewis-gatsby-starter-blog) and builds a little over it.

## Running the development server

- `yarn run develop` runs the development server on port `8000`.
